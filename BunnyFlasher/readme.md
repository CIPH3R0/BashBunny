# For the SourceCode
* I did not tought that I would opencource this project so it is not well commented or clean!
* I have deleted the .exe file due to falsepositive messages on AntiVirusses and because Admins tought my code was malisious, now my code is opensourced so everyone see's what is going on. do note that if you want you can compile a .exe for yourself at any time. (I am just not going to give a .exe to you because people would think it is malisious.)
